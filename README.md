# **react_TODO**
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeWcnFhkQxc
#### Description: Nice to meet you!
#### I am taking CS50 from Tokyo, Japan. My name is Icchii!
#### My FinalProject will be a very simple TODO application written using React.

## 【The following is a list of features.】
### ・Add TODO (input tag and button tag)
### ・Move a TODO from incomplete to complete.
### ・Moving a TODO from Completed to Incomplete
### ・Deleting a TODO

##### The above four are the core functions.


## 【How I made it.】
#### I've always used Evernote, a memo application, to make lists of TODOs and manage their progress.
#### However, I felt it was a problem that the text area was just expanding and I needed to edit it if I wanted to use it in a convenient way.
#### So, I decided to create a TODO application with "list view", "add and delete", and "visually clear way to show progress" in mind.
#### Also, after Flask, I was interested in the other side of the framework. Therefore, as something I wanted to try, I took on the challenge of first implementing the entire application in plain JavaScript, and then rewriting it in React.js.
#### Since it was a small application, the total amount of source code may not be as large as other FinalProjects, but I think we were able to rewrite all the code written in JS and actually conduct a good experiment to see what differences there were in the total amount of code and the implementation logic.
#### That's all I have to say about FinalProject.

## 【More details】
#### There are three main files for each.

### ・index.js
#### This file is responsible for importing React and ReactDom features, components created in other jsk files, and actually rendering and displaying them.

### ・App.jsk
#### **This is the most important file**, as it feeds components into the index.js file.
#### This is where all the functions, variables, states, props, and major functions are located.

### ・style.css
#### This is the file that keeps the style simple. I paid a lot of attention to the colors, rounded corners, and width.
